# Credit Risk Case Study

## Project Description
This project focuses on using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to solve a real-world business problem in the banking and finance sector. The goal is to identify patterns and potential risks associated with loan applicants to minimize financial loss due to default.

By analyzing consumer attributes and loan characteristics, this project aims to provide insights that can help in making informed lending decisions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **SciPy**: For statistical analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and analysis.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the following datasets:
1.  **Application Data** (`credit_risk_applicants.csv`): Contains information about the loan applicants (e.g., income, credit amount, family status).
2.  **Previous Application Data** (`credit_risk_previous_loans.csv`): Contains details of previous loan applications by the applicants.
3.  **Metadata** (`credit_risk_metadata.csv`): Description of columns in the datasets.

> **Note:** The dataset files might be large and are excluded from the repository. Please ensure you have the CSV files in the project root directory to run the notebook.

## Installation and Setup
1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_folder>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the analysis**:
    Launch Jupyter Notebook to view and execute the analysis.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Credit_Risk_Case_Study.ipynb
    ```

## Usage
Open the `Credit_Risk_Case_Study.ipynb` notebook. The notebook is structured to walk you through:
1.  Data Loading and Inspection
2.  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3.  Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate, Bivariate)
4.  Insights and Conclusions
